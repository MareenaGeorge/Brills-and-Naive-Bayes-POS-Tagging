Language used: Python 3

Q2: Bigram Probabilities
bigram.py has Q2
 Code to execute the program
 
 		python bigram.py ./HW2_S18_NLP6320-NLPCorpusTreebank2Parts-CorpusA-Unix.txt
         Input Sentence: The president wants to control the board 's control	
 It has three (3) scenarios:
	i. No Smoothing
	ii. Add-one Smoothing
	iii. Good-Turing Discounting based Smoothing
It builds a bigram model based on three scenarios and also computes the total probability for the input sentence.



It creates 3 txt files on Bigram model Generation
	i. BigramNoSmoothing.txt
	ii. BigramAddOneSmoothing.txt
	iii. BigramGoodTuringSmoothing.txt

Q3: Transformation Based POS Tagging
BrillsAndNBPosTagging.py has Q3

        Input Sentence: The_DT president_NN wants_VBZ to_TO control_??? the_DT board_NN 's_POS control_???
It has two parts
    i. Transformation-based POS Tagging
    ii. Na√Øve Bayesian Classification (Bigram) based POS Tagging
